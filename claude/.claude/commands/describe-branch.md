This branch contains a pull request that has been implemented by another engineer. Describe the changes in it.

Make sure to go into detail about each file that has major changes related to the task and what changes are in those files. You can group files together if needed, but the report should be detailed enough that I should get a good idea of what changed without needing to look at the file myself.

You can omit files from the report if they only have minor changes such as adding a new member to an object whose type was updated, but that is not really related to the task itself.
