description: Read current_progress.md and continue from there
---

Please read the `current_progress.md` file from the project root directory and continue the work from where it was left off.

Follow these steps:

1. Read and analyze the `current_progress.md` file
2. Understand the context, completed steps, and current status
3. Review any decisions or architectural choices that were made
4. Restore the todo list if one exists
5. Identify the next immediate action from the "Next Steps" section
6. Begin working on the next steps, picking up seamlessly from where the previous session ended

If the file doesn't exist, inform the user and ask what task they'd like to work on.

When continuing, acknowledge:
- What was previously accomplished
- What you're about to work on next
- Any important context you're carrying forward

Then proceed with the work without requiring additional confirmation unless there are ambiguities or decisions to be made. Update the file as you go too.
